This is a prototype for the Food Trucks service

When the user enters a valid address, it displays a list of nearby food trucks.

I chose the full-stack technical track. 

For the front end, I have used twitter bootstrap and for the backend, I have used Python-Django framework and also PostgreSQL for the database.

I know that Uber uses Python as a primary language for the backend, and also I have been developing in Python-Django the last two years. So, I had no second thoughts about what technology to use for the backend. I have worked with MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB before, but chose PostgreSQL for itâ€™s ease of use.

I have just started playing around with twitter bootstrap in my current job and I learnt more of while developing this app. I have also used a little bot of CSS for the static files.

I used the Python geocoder module to calculate the distance between an input address and the given locations in the database

A few more things I would have liked to add to the existing functionality:

- I realized just before submission that I could have made use of the Google Maps API and     show the food trucks on the map , instead of display it as a list, but I realized it a little too late to implement it more fully
- I could have added more tests
